	<h1>Michael <span>Jordan</span></h1>
	<p>
	Jordan <span style="font-size:45px;">was</span> a shooting guard who was also capable of playing as a small forward (the position he would primarily play during his second return to professional basketball with the Washington Wizards, and as a point guard. Jordan was known throughout his career for being a strong clutch performer. With the Bulls, he decided 25 games with field goals or free throws in the last 30 seconds, including two NBA Finals games and five other playoff contests. His competitiveness was visible in his prolific trash-talk and well-known work ethic. As the Bulls organization built the franchise around Jordan, management had to trade away players who were not “tough enough” to compete with him in practice. To help improve his defense, he spent extra hours studying film of opponents.
